Below is a single-file, stripped-down auth gate widget that loads your environment variables (from a .env file) within the same file—so no extra file edits are needed. This widget waits for the environment to load before listening to Firebase Auth’s state. When a user is authenticated, it displays your provided authenticated screen; otherwise, it shows the unauthenticated screen. # gpt_chat_widget
